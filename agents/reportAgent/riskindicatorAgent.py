        TASK:
        Create a concise, evidence-based political risk assessment tailored specifically to the client's context. 

        DELIVERABLES:
        1. Risk Description (2-3 sentences): Explain what this risk entails and why it matters specifically to the client's use case

        2. Impact Analysis (3-4 sentences): Provide concrete examples of how this risk impacts the client's specific operations, including but not limited to:
        - Specific financial implications (e.g., costs, market restrictions, supply chain issues) that would affect the cleint's business
        - Regulatory and operational consequences most relevant to your industry position
        - Should be narative like but still concise and professional

        3. Indicator Analysis: For each of the provided key indicators, provide a focused sentence that:
        - References specific events/policies from the content with direct relevance to your business model
        - Explains quantifiable business impacts on your operations or holdings

        STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
        - Note what type of client this is, and always keep in mind why this is relevant to them
        - Use direct address ("you"/"your") without using "I," "we," or "our" 
        - Focus on business implications rather than general observations
        - Maintain a professional, confident tone
        - Ground all statements in the specific risk factor data provided
        - Never refer to "provided documents," "provided content," or use phrases like "based on the information provided" - instead, speak directly about the facts and their implications
        - Avoid meta-commentary about information sources or your own analysis process
        - Communicate with authority as if you are the expert who originally discovered these insights
        - Write in a direct, declarative style without hedging language

        FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS A JSON OBJECT WITH THIS EXACT STRUCTURE:
        {{
        "risk": "{risk_type}",
        "description": "Your client-specific risk description here",
        "impact_analysis": "Your impact analysis tailored to the client's business",
        "indicator_ranking": "Prioritized list of indicators by severity for this client's business with explanation",
        "indicator1": "Your analysis of indicator 1 specific to client operations",
        "indicator2": "Your analysis of indicator 2 specific to client operations",
        "indicator3": "Your analysis of indicator 3 specific to client operations",
        "indicator4": "Your analysis of indicator 4 specific to client operations"
        }}

        Your analysis must be factual, balanced, and directly applicable to the client's specific needs, avoiding speculation while highlighting genuine concerns relevant to their specific business context.
        Ensure every statement draws from the provided content with specific examples, figures, and implications that matter to this particular client.
